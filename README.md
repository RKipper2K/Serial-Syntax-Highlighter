# Serial-Syntax-Highlighter
Code for a serial syntax highlighter I made during my 4th semester.

This code is meant to be run from the terminal; it receives 2 arguments:
- The path to a folder containing the txt files you wish to have analyzed.
- The path to a folder in which you want the program to write the output html files.

Once run the program will generate an HTML file in the output folder for each txt file found in the input folder, wth the text highlighted with the colors determined by our syntax analyzer.
