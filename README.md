# Serial-Syntax-Highlighter
Code for a serial syntax highlighter I made during my 5th semester.

This code is meant to be run from the terminal; it receives 2 arguments:
- The path to a folder containing the txt files you wish to have analyzed.
- The path to a folder in which you want the program to write the output html files.
